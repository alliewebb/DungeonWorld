<h1>DungeonWorld Character Sheets</h2>

1. As a user, I would like to be able to sign in so I can see my characters, or be able to create a new login so that I can begin to create characters.
2. As a user, I would like to be able to have the option of using a previous chacter I've made, or create a new one.
3. As a user, I would like to be able to update the stats of my characters and have the changes saved for next time so that I can pick up where I left off.
4. As a user, I would like to be able to roll the dice using the stat modifiers so that I don't have to calculate it myself.
5. As a user, I would like the result of my roll, and any consequences of that displayed to me so that I know what the result means for my character.
